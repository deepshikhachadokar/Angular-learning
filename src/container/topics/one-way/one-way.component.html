<h1><strong>One-way DataBinding</strong></h1>
<p>
  Imagine you have a whiteboard where you write some information. People can see
  what you’ve written, but they cannot write back on the board or change it. The
  information flows in one direction only, from you (the app) to the whiteboard
  (the screen).
</p>
<div>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You (the app) write: "Hello, John" on the whiteboard.</li>
    <li>Everyone sees "Hello, John" on the whiteboard.</li>
    <li>
      If you decide to change it to "Hello, Alice," the whiteboard updates
      automatically.
    </li>
    <li>
      But if someone tries to change "Alice" to "Mark" on the whiteboard, they
      cannot do it, because they only see the data and can't send it back to
      you.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="Interpolation">
  <h3>{{ message }}</h3>
  <h2>{{ topic1 }}</h2>
  <p>we initialized message in T.S file and calling in html file.</p>
  <p>
    these display simple and ensures that the user can only see or interact with
    the data without altering the app’s internal state.
  </p>

  <div class="limitation">
    <h2><strong>limitation</strong></h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Example: A Stock Market Ticker</h3>
      <p>
        A stock ticker app shows the current price of a company’s stock:
        $100.50.
        <li>The app’s logic updates the stock price whenever it changes.</li>
        <li>
          You can see the updated price, but you can’t type directly on the
          screen to change it.
        </li>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="property Binding"></div>
  <h1><strong>property Binding /Attribute Binding</strong></h1>
  <p>
    property binding in Angular is like connecting the app's data (or logic) to
    the HTML element's property. It allows you to dynamically set values for
    HTML properties based on the app’s logic. Think of it as feeding data from
    your app to an HTML element's attribute or property.
  </p>
  <div class="work">
    <h5>How Does It Work?</h5>
    <p>
      In Angular, property binding uses square brackets [] to bind a property of
      an HTML element to a value from your app’s component.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        property refers to the HTML element’s property (like src, disabled,
        value, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>expression is the value or logic from the Angular component.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image">
      <img [src]="PicUrl" alt="image" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="Event Binding"></div>
  <h1><strong>Event Binding</strong></h1>
  <p>
    Event binding type is when information flows from the view to the component
    when an event is triggered. The event could be a mouse click or keypress.
    The view sends the data to update the component.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unsurprisingly, it is the exact opposite of property binding, where the data
    goes from the component to the view.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clicking a button</li>
    <li>Typing in a text box</li>
    <li>Hovering over something with a mouse</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Event Binding is how Angular connects these actions (events) to your code so
    you can decide what happens next
  </p>
  <div class="examples">
    <h3><strong>Click Event</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Let’s say you have a button. When someone clicks the button, you want a
      message to appear.
    </p>
    <button (click)="showMessage()">Click Me!</button>
    <h6><strong>What happens:</strong></h6>
    <ul>
      <li>The user clicks the button.</li>
      <li>Angular sees the click event and runs the showMessage() method.</li>
      <li>
        The method shows an alert box saying, “Hello! You clicked the button.”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6><strong> Typing in a Text Box</strong></h6>
    <input
      type="text"
      (input)="onTyping($event)"
      placeholder="Type something..."
    />
    <p>You typed: {{ typedValue }}</p>
    <h6><strong>Hovering over an Element</strong></h6>
    <!-- <div (onHover)="onHover()" (onnotHover)="onend()">hover here</div> -->
    <div (mouseenter)="onHover()" (mouseleave)="onLeave()"><button>onHover!</button></div>
  </div>
</div>
